      <p>Long ago, in a dimension beyond stars and time, there emerged a city called Noctura 
        — a floating sanctuary built on imagination and light. It hovered above the clouds, 
        glowing like a second moon. Its spires were carved from crystallized dreams, and its
         streets shimmered under footsteps made of memory. The city was alive — fueled by the dreams
          of those who believed in the impossible.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="story-block" id="scene2" data-aos="flip-left">
      <img src="images/scene2.png" alt="Scene 2">
      <p>Noctura’s architecture defied logic — spiraling towers that curved into infinity, 
        bridges that grew with each thought, and gardens that bloomed from whispered wishes. 
        Artists from across galaxies arrived to sculpt music, paint sound, and write emotions into the skies. 
        Every corner of the city radiated a surreal harmony — as if the laws of reality had politely stepped aside.

    <section class="story-block"  id="scene3" data-aos="flip-right">
        <img src="images/scene3.png" alt="Scene 3">
        <p>In Noctura, transportation was an artform. Citizens glided on wind boards powered by pure stardust,
             leaving behind sparkling trails that danced through the air. The sky was a highway, and joy was the only speed limit. 
             Children surfed between towers, their laughter creating glowing ripples in the clouds — like skipping stones across a galaxy.

      <section class="story-block" id="scene4" data-aos="flip-up">
        <img src="images/scene4.png" alt="Scene 4">
        <p>The marketplace of Noctura isn’t on the ground — it drifts high in the clouds. 
            Vendors on floating platforms sell magical artifacts: bottled memories, 
            crystallized time, and fabric that ripples with dreams. Shoppers browse slowly, weightless, in a serene ballet above the clouds.

      <section class="story-block" id="scene5" data-aos="flip-down">
        <img src="images/scene5.png" alt="Scene 5">
        <p>At the very center of Noctura floats the Dream Core — a giant, 
            pulsating orb of light and memory. It glows with every citizen’s deepest hopes and powers the entire city.
             As it beats like a heart, it breathes life into the city’s magic.

        <img src="images/scene6.png" alt="Scene 6">
        <p>Nocturan schools drift among the clouds, suspended by balloons filled with helium and star gas. Inside,
            children sit in transparent classrooms, learning to speak with constellations and predict future dreams. 
            Their teachers are AI-guided stars, glowing gently as they teach.</p>

      <section class="story-block" id="scene7" data-aos="fade-up-left">
        <img src="images/scene7.png" alt="Scene 7">
        <p>Every evening, the sky above Noctura shifts colors based on the emotions of its people.
            If joy prevails, it turns golden; if curiosity dominates, it paints itself in violet swirls. 
            The entire atmosphere becomes a living canvas of mood and feeling.</p>

      <section class="story-block" id="scene8" data-aos="fade-down-right">
        <img src="images/scene8.png" alt="Scene 8">
        <p>Musicians in Noctura don’t use regular instruments — they play on light-harps, where each string emits sound and shimmering shapes.
             When a concert begins, the entire city watches in the sky as bridges of light form with each note.
             Music becomes something you can walk across.</p>

      <section class="story-block" id="scene9" data-aos="fade-down-left">
        <img src="images/scene9.png" alt="Scene 9">
        <p>The Hall of Dreams is where Noctura preserves its most powerful visions. When someone dreams vividly,
            their thoughts are captured and sculpted into 3D light-forms. Visitors come here to walk among dream statues — surreal,
            shifting, and alive with emotion.

        <p>As dawn nears, the city of Noctura slowly drifts higher — seeking a new sunrise with every passing night.
             The Dream Core dims softly, and a fresh cycle of dreams begins. Noctura is never the same — 
             it evolves with each story told and every dream imagined.
